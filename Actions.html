				<h2>How can we take advantage and counteract these new technologies?
				</h2>
				<p>There are different apps or devices that anyone can use and track their habits and health <i>-sleep cycles, heart rate- </i>
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, In these times where anyone can buy an electronic device (watches, smartphones) or health devices (Apple, pedometers), it is also the easiest way to monitor and have control of our personal life and health. A great example of these are <strong>Game apps </strong>these are apps that have the objective of encouraging the user to exercise, such as:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Pokemon Go</li>
					<li>MapMyFitness</li>
					<li>Justdance</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Their goal is making the user carry out physical activities without knowing that they are doing it.
				</p>

				<h3>Now you may ask, how do they keep the user logged in?</h3>
				<p>
					Some applications - others besides of the previous ones - use a system similar to Duolingo. Where they receive a report of what they have done and encourage them not to lose the mark. Others may use direct rewards such as: earning rewards for joining various health-related programs and tracking progress toward a goal.
				</p>
				<p>
					What I have said previously are ways in which devices or apps can be implemented into our daily habits or routines.
