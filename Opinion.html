					<h2>
						How a Sedentary Lifestyle Affects Heart Health?
					</h2>
					<p><i>On this occasion I share the opinion of:</i></p>
					<h3>
						Dr. Erin D. Michos; She is an Associate Professor of Medicine within the Division of Cardiology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
					</h3>
					<p>
						The modernization that man has been implementing since the '50s has resulted in most jobs now being done in a sitting position. One of the reasons why someone has taken up a sedentary life without even realizing it is with the simple action of sitting down.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most adults in the country have a job that requires them to sit for 8 hours and if we add other actions that we perform while sitting such as: driving, eating, watching television or even doing your hobby clearly ended up being â…” of your day being seated down, Unfortunately, it is a way to trigger diseases such as like: diabetes, heart disease and your cardiovascular risk really goes up.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is without taking into consideration the time we see on the screen of our work or cell phone.
					</p>
					<p>
						She also encourages us to do daily exercise even if it's just walking from one point to another, and do daily exercise like 30 to 1 h daily or 5 hours a week.
					</p>
					<p>
						In case you're wondering if comparing 10 hours of sitting to 1 hour of exercise cancels it out, Dr. Michos encourages that there are different studies that say it will minimize long-term damage, even though that still being a lot of hours of sitting,
					</p>
					<p>
						For this case, Dr. Micho shares a routine in which anyone who tends to sit for a long time can follow, which is:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							For every 20 minutes of sitting, try to stand for eight minutes and move around for  two minutes. 
						</li>
					</ul>
