					<h2>Does advancing technology provide cures for heart disease or is it a source of a sedentary lifestyle that contributes to heart disease?</h2>
					
					<p>
						Sedentary behaviors have been identified as one of the major causes of many chronic diseases all around the country, but it also has helped to shape the world to what it is nowadays. It has helped improve the ability in the medical field on treating such diseases. This very hit has also made its way in our daily lives with the purpose of facilitating our daily chores to our own necessities.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The goal of technology is to make our life easier and spend the least amount of energy possible, so we could use such energy in areas that we may like to improve. The result, to everyone's surprise, is simply letting the applications/modernization take the reins and create in us bad habits, such as: 
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Lack of exercise or mobility</li>
						<li>Prolonged hours staring at the screen</li>
						<li>Sitting for a long time</li>
					</ul>
